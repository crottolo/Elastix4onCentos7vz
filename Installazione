Elastix is an unified communications server software that brings together IP PBX, email, IM, faxing and collaboration functionality. It has a Web interface and includes capabilities such as a call center software with predictive dialing.

The Elastix functionality is based on open source projects including Asterisk, FreePBX, HylaFAX, Openfire and Postfix. Those packages offer the PBX, fax, instant messaging and email functions, respectively.

Elastix is free software, released under the GNU General Public License.

The tutorial was prepared with our "CentOS 7" template and is meant to work on our self-managed virtual private servers.
